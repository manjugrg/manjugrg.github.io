<div class="container">
<p>Founded in 2011, The British College offers world-class education for aspiring students in Nepal to gain
     internationally-recognised qualifications from their two partner British Universities: the University 
     of the West of England (UWE) and Leeds Beckett University (LBU). </p>

<p>We have successfully established a distinctive identity as the pioneering global college in Nepal and offer 
    reputed UK degrees and courses that are relevant to the current job market, and enhance the employability of 
    each and every student. </p>

<p>Our aim is to provide students with a global learning experience and worldwide opportunities. We are further
     defined by our local-to-global approach in the provision of our degrees and courses which are staffed by tutors 
     and administrative personnel from the UK and Nepal. In this way, the College provides premium education that
      compels students and staff to be globally-minded - a notion which is further encouraged by the multinational
       companies involved in our student exchange programmes and internships. </p>

<p>We also believe that supporting and interacting with the local community is an integral part of student life, and 
    we are committed to achieving excellence in our research and upholding the highest standards of integrity.</p>
